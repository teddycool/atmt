# How to get started

## Development environment

You will need Python3 and some kind of git-client.

The main software is Visual Studio Code, install it for your platform from https://code.visualstudio.com/

When vscode is up and running, select extensions and search for platformio. This is a complete toolkit for all kind of embedded development. We will use the arduino platform.

We are using C++ and installing some extensions for that is a good idea. 

We will probably use PHP, Python and other stuff as well, and vscode is really good for that too.

Now, when the development environment is installed, clone the github repo.

## How to start working with the repo

* Create a github-account if you don't allready have one
* Navigate to https://github.com/teddycool/atmt
* Click the fork-button to get your own copy of this repo. Use the default and fork only the main-branch.
* Now you have your own copy of the repo in your accounbt and you can start working with it.
* Go the the local directory for your projects and start a terminal
* Run "git clone and the  path to your fork to get all the files
* For your own coding you might want to create a new branch and work in that.
* When you are done with your changes, commit them to your main and push them to your fork on github.
* Then use a pull-request from github to show and discuss the changes you made with the rest of the team. More info here: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests


## Open the project in VsCode

Now, start VsCode and open the folder named .../sw in vscode. 

My guess is that the problems starts here....

But hopefully it is possible to build the project and if you have an esp32 dev-board ready it might even be possible to download it.
