# How to ota a natmt

## Build the software
Build the software and be sure to have the ota capabilities present since these will be used the next time.

Look at the template file. More info to come...


Connect to the update api for the correct car from a web-browser. Each has its fixed ip. like http://192.168.2.3/update for car #1

Select the bin-file built before, usually located in /.pio/build/??/firmware.bin

The download process starts directly and the progress is visible. When completed the car resets and starts with the new software.

Pretty awesome...
